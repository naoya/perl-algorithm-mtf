NAME
    Algorithm::MTF - Move-to-front transform encoder/decoder

SYNOPSIS
      use Algorithm::MTF;

      my $encoder = Algorithm::MTF::Encoder->new;
      my $code = $mtf->encode("aaabac"); ## $code is [ 97, 0, 0, 98, 1, 99 ]

      my $decoder = Algorithm::MTF::Decoder->new;
      say $mtf->decode([ 97, 0, 0, 98, 1, 99 ]); # "aaabac"

DESCRIPTION
    The move-to-front (or MTF) transform is an encoding of data (typically a
    stream of bytes) designed to improve the performance of entropy encoding
    techniques of compression. When efficiently implemented, it is fast
    enough that its benefits usually justify including it as an extra step
    in data compression algorithms. (quote from en.wikipedia.org)
